So trying to convert it back will give the default timestamp.\\r\\nSee example.\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe json values for the timestamp should be the correspoinding one for the given date string so it we can restore the correct date/time.\\r\\nIt works when using datetime64[ns].\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.12.1.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.4.0-150-generic\\r\\nVersion               : #167~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 24 00:51:42 UTC 2023\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.1\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.2\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\nNone\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

For example:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndf.assign(x=lambda df: df[\\'y\\'] + 1).groupby(\\'x\\').agg([\\'sum\\', \\'mean\\'])\\r\\n```\\r\\nI wish there were an equivalent for Series.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nA new method on pandas Series would, given keyword arguments, assign them as rows, and return a pointer to itself (to enable chaining of statements). The implementation could look like this:\\r\\n```python\\r\\n    def assign(**kwargs) -> Series:\\r\\n        new_ser = self.copy(deep=False)\\r\\n        for k, v in kwargs.items():\\r\\n            new_ser.__set_item__(k, v)\\r\\n        return new_ser\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative is to do nothing, and users continue to break up statements into multiple statements. For example, rather than\\r\\n```python\\r\\nsummary = series.assign(grand_total=lambda s: s.sum()).to_string()\\r\\n```\\r\\nthe user breaks it up as:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nseries.loc[\\'grand_total\\'] = series.sum()\\r\\nsummary = series.to_string()\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis simple example makes the alternative look not so bad, but when you have chains of multiple method calls involving one or more `assign` statements, when you use Series you have to break it up, while with DataFrames you can chain them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\nI [searched issues for \"series assign\"](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+series+assign) and didn\\'t find an issue that duplicates this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething that may confuse readers is that DataFrame.assign makes new columns, while the proposed Series.assign makes new rows (provided that you think of Series as column vectors, which is natural since that\\'s how they\\'re displayed, they have an index, and that\\'s what you get when you call `.to_frame()`).',\n",

My stackoverflow\\r\\nquestion [1] was closed for IMHO no good reason. The linked duplicates\\r\\ndo not help me [2].

To opt-in to the future behavior,\\r\\n    set `pd.set_option('future.no_silent_downcasting', True)` s = s.replace(replace_dict)\\r\\n\\r\\nI found several postings about this future warning. But my problem is I\\r\\ndon't understand why it happens and I also don't know how to solve it.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n#!/usr/bin/python3\\r\\nfrom pandas import Series\\r\\ns = Series(['foo', 'bar'])\\r\\nreplace_dict = {'foo': 2, 'bar': 4}\\r\\ns = s.replace(replace_dict)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI am aware of other questions and answers [2] but I don't know how to\\r\\napply them to my own code. The reason might be that I do not understand\\r\\nthe cause of the error.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe linked answers using `astype()` before replacement. But again: I\\r\\ndon't know how this could solve my problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks in advance\\r\\nChristian\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] -- <https://stackoverflow.com/q/77995105/4865723>\\r\\n[2] -- <https://stackoverflow.com/q/77900971/4865723>\\r\\n[3] -- <https://groups.google.com/g/pydata/c/yWbl4zKEqSE>\",\n",

But the docs for `Series.fillna()` indicate that a value of `None` is valid.  So you can\\'t do a `fillna()` with a value of `None`\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nUnclear.

The presence of duplicated columns can complicate data analysis, lead to redundancy, and affect computational efficiency. Currently, pandas lacks a built-in method to easily drop duplicated columns from a DataFrame.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nThe proposed feature introduces a new functionality to pandas, enabling users to drop duplicated columns from a DataFrame effortlessly. This is achieved through the addition of a drop_duplicated_columns method within a new class named DuplicateCols.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\\r\\n    \\'A\\' : [1,2,3,4,5],\\r\\n    \\'B\\' : [10,20,30,40,50],\\r\\n    \\'C\\' : [2,4,6,8,10],\\r\\n    \\'D\\' : [10,20,30,40,50],\\r\\n    \\'E\\' : [1,2,3,4,5],\\r\\n    \\'F\\' : [1,2,3,4,5],\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\nclass DuplicateCols:\\r\\n    def __init__(self, dataset):\\r\\n        self.temp = set()\\r\\n        self.dupCols = []\\r\\n        self.nonDupCols = []\\r\\n        self.compareCols = []\\r\\n        self.dataset = dataset\\r\\n\\r\\n    def duplicateColumns(self):\\r\\n        for col in self.dataset.columns:\\r\\n            col_data = tuple(self.dataset[col])\\r\\n            if col_data in self.temp:\\r\\n                self.dupCols.append(col)\\r\\n            else:\\r\\n                self.temp.add(col_data)\\r\\n                self.nonDupCols.append(col)\\r\\n        return self.dupCols\\r\\n\\r\\n    def nonDuplicateColumns(self):\\r\\n        self.duplicateColumns()\\r\\n        return self.nonDupCols\\r\\n\\r\\n    def dropDuplicateColumns(self):\\r\\n        self.duplicateColumns()\\r\\n        return self.dataset[self.nonDupCols]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Example Usage:\\r\\nduplicates = DuplicateCols(data)\\r\\nprint(\"Duplicated Columns:\", duplicates.duplicateColumns())\\r\\nprint(\"Non-Duplicated Columns:\", duplicates.nonDuplicateColumns())\\r\\nresult_df = duplicates.dropDuplicateColumns()\\r\\nprint(\"DataFrame after dropping duplicated columns:\")\\r\\nprint(result_df)\\r\\n\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_',\n",

       "  'body': '#57594 BUG: df.plot makes a shift to the right if frequency multiplies to n > 1\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause of this bug is that by default all elements are generated to align to the end of\\r\\na period instead of at the start and the period technically does not end at the start of\\r\\nthe last period but rather just before the period subsequent to the last period. To fix this\\r\\nproblem we therefore passed a parameter stating that the elements should be aligned to\\r\\nthe start of the period instead of the end. Parameter \"how=S\" was added in pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/timeseries.py::maybe_convert_index(), \\r\\non the function call data.index.asfreq(freq=freq_str, how = \"S\").  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional tests were added to test whether input data match data in plot and one test was merged into one the added test to reduce code duplication.

It should also be noted that as the rcParams are ignored, Matplotlib stylesheets are also ignored if applied to these elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Pandas does this **only** for these specific elements in the boxplot, it can result in some terrible looking plots if someone uses a comprehensive set of rcParams (or stylesheet) that have a significantly different set of colours.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A solution?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have looked into where this occurs, and all the relevant code resides in:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/boxplot.py\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, methods `_get_colors()`  and `_color_attrs(self)`. These two methods (among other bits of linked code) basically pick specific colours from the assigned colormap and apply them to the plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know what needs adjusting, and could put in a PR. However, due to the nature of rcParams being the \"default\" and hence having the lowest priority in terms of application, I see no way to adjust the code without changing the current default colours (i.e. blue, and a green median taken from the \"tab10\" colormap). \\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why I am filing this \\'bug\\', as I can see this change might be objectionable, and as such will require further discussion on the appropriate solution. The solution I am proposing, of using matplotlib rcParam defaults, would result in the following \"default\" plot:\\r\\n\\r\\n![matplotlib-default](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/40262729/6d2af3ab-a99d-459c-84d5-1e072d2b8d94)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy personal opinion is that this visual change is minor, and therefore should be implemented. I would also argue that accessibility is hindered by the current implementation (colour blindness being an example). \\r\\n\\r\\n### Items to note\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile reviewing the code I noticed the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  #40769 is not completely solved as it was only fixed for the method `plot.box` and not `boxplot` (the two methods use different code within `boxplot.py`) - see line 376 of `boxplot.py` for the hardcoded black value for the caps using the method `boxplot` `result = np.append(result, \"k\")`\\r\\n2.  the section of code refactored by #30346 does not distinguish between `edgecolor` and `facecolor` when `patch_artist` is set to `True`. This may or may not have been intentional, but should probably be separated out as it is the only reason `patch.facecolor` features this current bug report. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIf colours are set in matplotlib rcParams (or stylesheets) by the user, they should be applied to the plot, not ignored. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\ncommit                : 69f03a39ecf654e23490cc6d2e103c5e06ccae18\\r\\npython                : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.7.4-2-MANJARO\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Feb 10 09:41:20 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+448.g69f03a39ec\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.8\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.2\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.98.15\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.2.6\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.1.9\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.22.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.2.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.6\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.2.0\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.2.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

For example:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndf.assign(x=lambda df: df[\\'y\\'] + 1).groupby(\\'x\\').agg([\\'sum\\', \\'mean\\'])\\r\\n```\\r\\nI wish there were an equivalent for Series.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nA new method on pandas Series would, given keyword arguments, assign them as rows, and return a pointer to itself (to enable chaining of statements). The implementation could look like this:\\r\\n```python\\r\\n    def assign(**kwargs) -> Series:\\r\\n        new_ser = self.copy(deep=False)\\r\\n        for k, v in kwargs.items():\\r\\n            new_ser.__set_item__(k, v)\\r\\n        return new_ser\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative is to do nothing, and users continue to break up statements into multiple statements. For example, rather than\\r\\n```python\\r\\nsummary = series.assign(grand_total=lambda s: s.sum()).to_string()\\r\\n```\\r\\nthe user breaks it up as:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nseries.loc[\\'grand_total\\'] = series.sum()\\r\\nsummary = series.to_string()\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis simple example makes the alternative look not so bad, but when you have chains of multiple method calls involving one or more `assign` statements, when you use Series you have to break it up, while with DataFrames you can chain them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\nI [searched issues for \"series assign\"](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+series+assign) and didn\\'t find an issue that duplicates this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething that may confuse readers is that DataFrame.assign makes new columns, while the proposed Series.assign makes new rows (provided that you think of Series as column vectors, which is natural since that\\'s how they\\'re displayed, they have an index, and that\\'s what you get when you call `.to_frame()`).', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57736/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57736/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}\n",

But the docs for `Series.fillna()` indicate that a value of `None` is valid.  So you can\\'t do a `fillna()` with a value of `None`\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nUnclear.  Do we want to allow `None` as the possible value in fillna()?  This could be a docs issue or a code issue.\\r\\n\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 4.4.0-19041-Microsoft\\r\\nVersion               : #3996-Microsoft Thu Jan 18 16:36:00 PST 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.2.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.1\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57723/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57723/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}\n",

It should also be noted that as the rcParams are ignored, Matplotlib stylesheets are also ignored if applied to these elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Pandas does this **only** for these specific elements in the boxplot, it can result in some terrible looking plots if someone uses a comprehensive set of rcParams (or stylesheet) that have a significantly different set of colours.\\r\\n\\r\\n### A solution?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have looked into where this occurs, and all the relevant code resides in:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/plotting/_matplotlib/boxplot.py\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, methods `_get_colors()`  and `_color_attrs(self)`. These two methods (among other bits of linked code) basically pick specific colours from the assigned colormap and apply them to the plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know what needs adjusting, and could put in a PR. However, due to the nature of rcParams being the \"default\" and hence having the lowest priority in terms of application, I see no way to adjust the code without changing the current default colours (i.e. blue, and a green median taken from the \"tab10\" colormap). \\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why I am filing this \\'bug\\', as I can see this change might be objectionable, and as such will require further discussion on the appropriate solution. The solution I am proposing, of using matplotlib rcParam defaults, would result in the following \"default\" plot:\\r\\n\\r\\n![matplotlib-default](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/40262729/6d2af3ab-a99d-459c-84d5-1e072d2b8d94)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy personal opinion is that this visual change is minor, and therefore should be implemented. I would also argue that accessibility is hindered by the current implementation (colour blindness being an example). \\r\\n\\r\\n### Items to note\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile reviewing the code I noticed the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  #40769 is not completely solved as it was only fixed for the method `plot.box` and not `boxplot` (the two methods use different code within `boxplot.py`) - see line 376 of `boxplot.py` for the hardcoded black value for the caps using the method `boxplot` `result = np.append(result, \"k\")`\\r\\n2.  the section of code refactored by #30346 does not distinguish between `edgecolor` and `facecolor` when `patch_artist` is set to `True`. This may or may not have been intentional, but should probably be separated out as it is the only reason `patch.facecolor` features this current bug report. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIf colours are set in matplotlib rcParams (or stylesheets) by the user, they should be applied to the plot, not ignored. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\ncommit                : 69f03a39ecf654e23490cc6d2e103c5e06ccae18\\r\\npython                : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.7.4-2-MANJARO\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Feb 10 09:41:20 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+448.g69f03a39ec\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.8\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.2\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.98.15\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.2.6\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.1.9\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.22.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.2.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.6\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.2.0\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.2.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57709/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57709/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}\n"
